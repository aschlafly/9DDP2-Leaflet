The data come from the US Geologic Service (USGS) at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_month.csv.
It is updated every minute, so I output the time at which the data was read in. 
It only includes earthques with magnitude greater than 2.5.  

``` {r readdata}
qdb = read.csv(url("https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv"))
quakes = qdb %>% select(c("latitude","longitude",mag))
Sys.time()
```


``` {r make_leaflet_map}
quakes %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = quakes$longitude, 
                   lat = quakes$latitude, 
                   radius = quakes$mag,
                   popup = quakes$mag,
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 0.3)
```
